Inlet is a "plugin" for CodeMirror2 which pops up a slider whenever you click on a number or a color picker when you click on a Hex string (i.e. "#ff0000")

This project is inspired by Bret Victor's talk ["Inventing on Principle"](https://vimeo.com/36579366)

The the slider code is adapted from Gabriel Florit's [Water project](http://gabrielflor.it/water) 

The [Color Picker library](https://github.com/mudcube/Color-Picker)

This project is used in enjalot's [Tributary](http://mainstem.org)





We code things like this (and with this) at http://visual.ly
